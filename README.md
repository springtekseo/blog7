In the middle of the 1960s, NASA created memory foam, which is also referred to as viscoelastic foam. Memory foam, which is made of polyurethane, was created to lessen the intense pressure astronauts experience when entering and leaving the Earth's atmosphere. Memory foam was quickly realised to have numerous uses and is currently found in mattresses, pillows, and mattress toppers.

Springtek Memory Foam absorbs body heat more quickly than ordinary memory foam since it is not temperature sensitive. In order to keep you cool, it absorbs heat from your body and disperses it throughout the mattress. The Next Generation Memory Foam is what it is.
